# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Electrophysiological modeling of fibroblasts and their interaction with myocytes.**   
Sachse FB, Moreno AP, Abildskov JA. _Ann Biomed Eng._ year volume page
[17999190](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17999190) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Experimental studies have shown that cardiac fibroblasts are electrically
inexcitable, but can contribute to electrophysiology of myocardium in various
manners. The aim of this computational study was to give insights in the
electrophysiological role of fibroblasts and their interaction with myocytes.
We developed a mathematical model of fibroblasts based on data from whole-cell
patch clamp and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies. The fibroblast model
was applied together with models of ventricular myocytes to assess effects of
heterogeneous intercellular electrical coupling. We investigated the
modulation of action potentials of a single myocyte varying the number of
coupled fibroblasts and intercellular resistance. Coupling to fibroblasts had
only a minor impact on the myocyte's resting and peak transmembrane voltage,
but led to significant changes of action potential duration and upstroke
velocity. We examined the impact of fibroblasts on conduction in one-
dimensional strands of myocytes. Coupled fibroblasts reduced conduction and
upstroke velocity. We studied electrical bridging between ventricular myocytes
via fibroblast insets for various coupling resistors. The simulations showed
significant conduction delays up to 20.3 ms. In summary, the simulations
support strongly the hypothesis that coupling of fibroblasts to myocytes
modulates electrophysiology of cardiac cells and tissues.
